## üíªUsage

1. <h5>Open two terminal windows:</h5>
  In Windows, press Windows + R, type cmd, and press Enter.
  In macOS/Linux, open your preferred terminal application.

2. <h5>Navigate to the project directory:</h5>
  In both terminal windows, use the cd command to change directory to the root of your project folder. This folder should contain both client and server subdirectories.

3. <h5>Run the frontend:</h5>
  In one terminal window, type ```cd client``` and press Enter. This changes directory to the client subfolder.
  Then, type ```npm start ```and press Enter. This will start the frontend development server.

4. <h5>Run the backend:</h5>
  In the other terminal window, type ```python app.py``` or ```python3 app.py``` or simply run the code. This will start the backend development server.

5. <h5>Access the web app:</h5>
  Open a web browser.
  In the address bar, type http://localhost:3000. This opens the frontend app running on the development server.

Additional notes:

- The frontend app will automatically reload in the browser whenever you make changes to the code.
- You may see console messages related to the development process in both terminal windows.
- Remember to stop the servers (Ctrl+C in most terminals) when you're done to avoid resource usage.
